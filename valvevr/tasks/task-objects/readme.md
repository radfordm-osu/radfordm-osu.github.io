#Task Objects
Task objects are empty objects that have a script that extends Task.cs. Task names and relevant target objects are set on these objects. There are several task objects and types in the current system.

##Interactable Pickup
Interactable Pickup will signal to the Task Watcher once their target object has been picked up by the user. The prefab for this is TaskInteractablePickUp.
