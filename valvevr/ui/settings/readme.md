- Very Low (Half texture quality, no shadows)
- Low (No shadows)
- Medium (Rough Shadows)
- High (Lower quality shadows)
- Very High (1/2 quality of Ultra)
- Ultra (Best quality)

### Dominant Hand
The task display will appear on the non-dominant hand. Changing this setting will change what hand the display appears on. More information on the task display [here](/valvevr/tasks/hand-hud).
