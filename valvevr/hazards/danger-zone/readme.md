# Danger Zone

Danger Zones are areas that will highlight themselves and alert the user to leave as soon as they are entered by displaying a danger banner and highlight the area extent yellow.
There are Danger Zones and Hand Danger Zones.

### Danger Zones
This type of danger zone will only trigger if the user's head enters the space. These should be used for areas a user may be able to (but should avoid) walking through.

### Hand Danger Zones
Hand danger zones respond to both the user's hands and head. However, these zones cannot be teleported through. These are best for smaller objects or areas a user cannot walk through (i.e. sawblades, trash compactor, etc).
